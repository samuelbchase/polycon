    Welcome to Polycon.org
</h2>
        <p>
            PolyCon is the premiere gaming convention of the Central Coast of California.
            Since 1983, we've provided the gaming community with a place to gather to enjoy
            gaming and fun. PolyCon is presented by students and alumni of California
            Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, California.
            <br>
            <br>
            We host monthly conventions held in the Cal Poly University Union, as well
            as one major convention in June called "PolyCon." Last year's PolyCon 34 was
            a great success, and we look forward to June 2017's PolyCon 35!
            <br>
            <br>
            We also partner with the weekly gaming club "Game Theory", held in Cal Poly, BLD 8 Room 122
            every Friday evening from 5PM until 10PM. Look for more info on the Game Theory tab
            <br>
            <br>
            If you're interested in taking part in our events, or coming to help
            plan events with the club please check out our Contact Info page.
