    <h2>PolyCon XXXV</h2>
    <p>
        Our most anticipated event of the year, PolyCon XXXVI is no doubt going to
        go down in history as one of the best PolyCons ever. We invite you to join us
        for a three day extravaganza held in the entire Cal Poly University Union. Featuring
        tons of board games, plentiful RPGs, LARPs and presentations by groups such as
        Amtgard and the SCA, a fully stocked vendor area, and fan favorites like
        Waffle night, the ice cream social, and bad movie night. PolyCon never disappoints!
        <br>
        <br>
        PolyCon is hosted mid June, and we will provide more info and open game sign ups later
        into the academic year.
