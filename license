In most of my projects I include nonrestrictive licenses in hope that other will benefit from learning and using my projects. 
In this case however, I specifically do not allow anyone to use, copy, modify, distribute, or fork this code. 
I offer my apologies, as this is only because this code is not made for me, however I do want to display the source.
